		 <title>What is the CDK?</title> 
		 <para>
	The CDK classes are Java utitility classes for ChemoInformatics and Computational chemistry, written in Java. They are developed constantly developed parallel
	to other projects that make use of them.
	They are a complete re-write of the CompChem classes that were the basis of <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint">JChemPaint</ulink>, a Java Editor 
	for 2D chemical structures, and of <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JMDraw">JMDraw</ulink>, a Java package for the graphical layout of 2D chemical structures 
		</para>
	
		<para>
	A re-write was needed to in order to assure the widest possible usability. It is also intended to port
	<ulink url="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">JMol</ulink>, a 3D molecular visualization tool, to the CDK.	
		</para>
		<para>		
			The CDK classes support (or will support, as soon as ported from the old CompChem library): 
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Classes for Atoms, Molecules and other chemical concepts.

						Utilities for importing and exporting chemical structures (Molecules or arrays of Atoms) using standard chemical files format.

					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						An isomorphisms tester that compares to structures and returns if they are isomorph. I'm almost sure, that the implementation is not strictly valid, but it 
						seems to work
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						A SMILES parser (hidden as a static method in compchem.ChemFileUtils), which so far only implements the SSMILES standard.

						An implementation of John Figueras, "Ring Perception Using Breadth-First Search", J. Chem. Inf. Comput Sci. 1996, 36, 986-991.

			The CDK project is still in its initial stage. The people involved are those in the 
			<ulink url="http://www.ice.mpg.de/departments/cheminf">Chemoinformatics Group</ulink> at the 
			<ulink url="http://www.ice.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena</ulink>,
	  		as well as <ulink url="mailto:egonw@sci.kun.nl">Egon Willighagen</ulink> from the University of Nijmegen,
			who is also involved with JChemPaint and many other Java Chemoinformatics programs, and 
			<ulink url="mailto:gezelter@maul.chem.nd.edu">Dan Gezelter</ulink>, the initiator of JMol, a 3D viewer and analyzer for molecules .

			Now, the rewrite of these CompChem/CDK library classes do somehow effect
			all of our projects. 
			All of our code relies to some extend on the so-called CompChem classes
			for computational chemistry. I started this chemistry library when I
			started programming SENECA, my system for Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation. 
			It turned out that some of
			the code had design flaws that prevented others, like the authors of
			(<ulink url="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">JMol</ulink>) to use it. 
			Egon, Dan and I now met last month at the University of Notre Dame,
			South Bend, Chicago, and redesigned the CompChem classes, calling the
			new project the "Chemistry Development Kit, CDK". 
		</para>	
		<para>
			The development of all of our project will be organized via Sourceforge.
			Unfortunately, this system, as good as it is, turns out to be buggy and
			overloaded, but we'll stay with it, because this will not be so much of
			a problem as soon as the projects are established, we have the CVS
			access via SSH up'n running and can actually do some programming.
		</para>	
		<para>
			Our chemoinformatics and computational chemistry projects on Sourceforge
			are:
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<ulink
						url="http://cdk.sourceforge.net">The Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)</ulink>,
						which is our "new" library for
						Chemoinformatics and
						Computational Chemistry.
					</para>
				</listitem>					
				<listitem>

						<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint</ulink>
						for JChemPaint development.

				<listitem>
					<para>
						<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JMDraw">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JMDraw</ulink>

						1.0
					</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/compchem">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/compchem</ulink>

			Of course, at Notre Dame we were not able to do all the implementations.
			We decided to take some more care this time and start with UML. There
			are some UML diagrams on the CVS at
			http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cdk which can be views with the
			program Linux program dia. Egon has moved them to ArgoUML,
			which is Java and can also be used under Windows. 
		</para>
		<para>
			The first step to do now is to create java classes for of all the
			existing UML diagrams. The second step is to fill them with life as it become clear what is
			needed while porting JChemPaint to them

		 <title>Who develops the CDK?</title> 
		 <para>
			The CDK is a joint venture of the JMol and JChemPaint developers who would like to see a general-purpose open-source library for 
			computational chemistry and chemoinformatics. Check the developers list on the <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cdk">CDK pages.</ulink>

		 <title>How is the CDK developed</title> 
		 <para>
			The CDK is mantained as a <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</ulink> project under
			<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cdk">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cdk</ulink>. 
			Please check the SourceForge site documentation for more.
