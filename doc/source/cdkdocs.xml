		 <title>What is the CDK?</title> 
		 <para>
	The CDK classes are Java utitility classes for ChemoInformatics and Computational chemistry, written in Java. They are developed constantly developed parallel
	to other projects that make use of them.
	They are a complete re-write of the CompChem classes that were the basis of <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint">JChemPaint</ulink>, a Java Editor 
	for 2D chemical structures, and of <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JMDraw">JMDraw</ulink>, a Java package for the graphical layout of 2D chemical structures 
		</para>
	
		<para>
	A re-write was needed to in order to assure the widest possible usability. It is also intended to port
	<ulink url="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">JMol</ulink>, a 3D molecular visualization tool, to the CDK.	
		</para>
		<para>		
			The CDK classes support (or will support, as soon as ported from the old CompChem library):

			The CDK project is still in its initial stage. The people involved are those in the 
			<ulink url="http://www.ice.mpg.de/departments/cheminf">Chemoinformatics Group</ulink> at the 
			<ulink url="http://www.ice.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena</ulink>,
	  		as well as <ulink url="mailto:egonw@sci.kun.nl">Egon Willighagen</ulink> from the University of Nijmegen,
			who is also involved with JChemPaint and many other Java Chemoinformatics programs, and 
			<ulink url="mailto:gezelter@maul.chem.nd.edu">Dan Gezelter</ulink>, the initiator of JMol, a 3D viewer and analyzer for molecules .

		<para>
			Now, the rewrite of these CompChem/CDK library classes do somehow effect
			all of our projects. 
			All of our code relies to some extend on the so-called CompChem classes
			for computational chemistry. I started this chemistry library when I
			started programming SENECA, my system for Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation. 
			It turned out that some of
			the code had design flaws that prevented others, like the authors of
			(<ulink URL="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">JMol</ulink>) to use it. 
			Egon, Dan and I now met last month at the University of Notre Dame,
			South Bend, Chicago, and redesigned the CompChem classes, calling the
			new project the "Chemistry Development Kit, CDK". 
		</para>	
		<para>
			The development of all of our project will be organized via Sourceforge.
			Unfortunately, this system, as good as it is, turns out to be buggy and
			overloaded, but we'll stay with it, because this will not be so much of
			a problem as soon as the projects are established, we have the CVS
			access via SSH up'n running and can actually do some programming.
		</para>	
		<para>
			We have three projects on Sourceforge
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/compchem">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/compchem</ulink>
						which contains the "old" compchem sources but will now be almost
						completely dedicated to the CDK development
					</para>
				</listitem>	
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint</ulink>
						for JChemPaint development.
					</para>
				</listitem>	
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JMDraw">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JMDraw</ulink>
						for the development of JMDraw, which is the 2D rendering engine, also used in JChemPaint
					</para>

		</para>
		<para>
			Of course, at Notre Dame we were not able to do all the implementations.
			We decided to take some more care this time and start with UML. There
			are some UML diagrams on the CVS at
			http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/compchem which can be views with the
			program Linux program dia. Egon has moved them to ArgoUML,
			which is Java and can also be used under Windows. 
		</para>
		<para>
			The first step to do now is to create java classes for of all the
			existing UML diagrams. The second step is to fill them with life as it become clear what is
			needed while porting JChemPaint to them

		 <para>
			The CDK is a joint venture of the JMol and JChemPaint developers who would like to see a general-purpose open-source library for

  	<title>Project Reference</title>
  	<section>
		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
			The project reference is supposed to be a compendium for all kind of information related to the 
			CDK project, as there are questions regarding the program design, how to document things or
			what to do in order to update the web pages.
		</para>
	</section>
    	<section>
		<title>Design Considerations</title>
		<para>
			The most important aspect in the design of the CDK is the clean separation of function. 
			We decided to use the meanwhile classical model-view-controler design pattern.
			(see for example <ulink url="http://compsci.about.com/science/compsci/library/weekly/aa030600a.htm">
			this article on CompSci and the references therein</ulink> for more).
			The basic concept is that there is a single MODEL that contains the data. 
			In our case the data would be an internal representation of a molecule, a chemical reaction, an
			ensemble of molcecules, etc.
		</para>
		<para>
			There can be multiple VIEWs of the same model
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						a 2D representation like the one in JChemPaint, consisting mainly of
						lines, representing bonds and some Elementsymbols, or
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						a 3D representation, rotatable, nicely shaded with perspective scaling.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>
		<para>
			The CONTROLER gives the user means of manipulating how the VIEW of the
			MODEL is supposed to look like, e.g. for rotating a molecule in the 3D
			view. But is also may provide a way of manipulating the model, so that a
			user of JChemPaint can, for example, remove a bond from a molecule, etc.
		</para>
		<para>
			Cleanly separating these parts, using well-defined interfaces between
			them, gives you great flexibility. Making an applet out of JChemPaint,
			i.e. plugin a Java 1.1.8 GUI where there is now a Browser-incompatible
			Java 2 interface, would be much easier if JCP was nicely designed using
			the MVC paradigm.
		</para>
		<para>
			The MODEL in the CDK consists of
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Java classes for chemical/physical concepts, like:
						<itemizedlist>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Element
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Isotope
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Atom
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Bond
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Molecule
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									Ring
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									etc.
								</para>
							</listitem>
						</itemizedlist>
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Java classes that allow for the administration of the above:
						<itemizedlist>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									ChemModel (may contain all of the above)
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									ChemSequence (contains a sequence of ChemModels, e.g. to represent
									the course of a reaction, where reactants, intermediates and products
									are stored in separated ChemModels)
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									ChemFile (a collection of ChemModels and/or ChemSequences)
								</para>
							</listitem>
						</itemizedlist>
						
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Java finder classes for the production of value-added representations from concepts in a ChemModel
						<itemizedlist>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									RingFinder, for example, would produce a SetOfRings, when given a molecule.
								</para>
							</listitem>
							<listitem>
								<para>
									BendFinder would produce a list of Bends (a Bend is an ensemble of
									three atoms from a molecule that make up an angle)
								</para>
							</listitem>
						</itemizedlist>
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			The full concept can be found on the photograph that I send you in the
			first mail and in Egons UML diagrams. The VIEW and the CONTROLER are now in the responsibility of the
			particular programming team, in our case the JChemPaint team. 
			The JChemPaint team, for example,  would produce a 2DRenderer.class which creates the regular 2D drawing program look
			from the underlying model. 
			The JCP controller would add mouse control for drawing and deleting
			bonds, rotating molecules, etc.
