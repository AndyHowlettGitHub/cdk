            			The CDK project is still in its initial stage. The people involved are those in the 
            			<a href="http://www.ice.mpg.de/departments/cheminf">Chemoinformatics Group</a> at the 
            			<a href="http://www.ice.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena</a>,
            	  		as well as <a href="mailto:egonw@sci.kun.nl">Egon Willighagen</a> from the University of Nijmegen,
            			who is also involved with JChemPaint and many other Java Chemoinformatics programs, and 
            			<a href="mailto:gezelter@maul.chem.nd.edu">Dan Gezelter</a>, the initiator of JMol, a 3D viewer and analyzer for molecules .

            			Now, the rewrite of these CompChem/CDK library classes do somehow effect
            			all of our projects. 
            			All of our code relies to some extend on the so-called CompChem classes
            			for computational chemistry. I started this chemistry library when I
            			started programming SENECA, my system for Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation. 
            			It turned out that some of
            			the code had design flaws that prevented others, like the authors of
            			(<a href="">JMol</a>) to use it. 
            			Egon, Dan and I now met last month at the University of Notre Dame,
            			South Bend, Chicago, and redesigned the CompChem classes, calling the
            			new project the "Chemistry Development Kit, CDK". 
            		
         </p>
         <p>
            			The development of all of our project will be organized via Sourceforge.
            			Unfortunately, this system, as good as it is, turns out to be buggy and
            			overloaded, but we'll stay with it, because this will not be so much of
            			a problem as soon as the projects are established, we have the CVS
            			access via SSH up'n running and can actually do some programming.

            			We have three projects on Sourceforge

            			Of course, at Notre Dame we were not able to do all the implementations.
            			We decided to take some more care this time and start with UML. There
            			are some UML diagrams on the CVS at
            			http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/compchem which can be views with the
            			program Linux program dia. Egon has moved them to ArgoUML,
            			which is Java and can also be used under Windows. 
            		
         </p>
         <p>
            			The first step to do now is to create java classes for of all the
            			existing UML diagrams. The second step is to fill them with life as it become clear what is
            			needed while porting JChemPaint to them
