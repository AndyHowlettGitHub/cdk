        compiled into HTML with the Website DTD 2.0.

        The website can be compiled with Ant in three steps.
        First, you need to run <command>ant</command> in the
        directories <filename class="directory">cdk/doc/refs</filename>
        and <filename class="directory">cdk/doc/javadoc</filename>.
        That should generate a <filename>biblio.dbx</filename>, and
        <filename>keyword.index.xml</filename>.
        Then, run <command>ant</command> in 
        <filename class="directory">cdk/doc/website/source</filename>
      </para>
      <para>
        After is has been build, it can be checked with a webbrowser in the
        <filename class="directory">cdk/doc/website/target</filename>
        directory. Note, that the <filename>index.html</filename> is named
        <filename>website.html</filename> at this moment. That is changed
        automatically on the server, when it includes the news items.
