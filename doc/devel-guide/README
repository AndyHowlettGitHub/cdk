The DocBook XML 4.1.2 DTD and DocBook XSLT stylesheets are required
to validate this source documents and to convert it into (X)HTML and sorts.

Use xmllint to validate to document, e.g. on Debian:

> xmllint --catalogs --valid --noout guide.xml

Use xsltproc (or so) to create some non source version of the guide, e.g. on
Debian:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> xsltproc /usr/share/sgml/docbook/stylesheet/xsl/nwalsh/xhtml/chunk.xsl ../guide.xml

To upload it to SF do:

> cd build/..
> scp build/* cdk.sf.net:~/cdk-www/guides/devel/.
