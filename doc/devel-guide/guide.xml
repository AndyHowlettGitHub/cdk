      <para>
        Part of the website resides at www.sf.net, or more specifically, at
        cdk.sf.net. The main page, however, is at this moment hosted at the
        CUBIC in Cologne, at a machine called 'almost'.
      </para>
      <para>
        The SF.net hosted part contains the HTML API's created with JavaDoc,
        and the Users' and the Developers' Guides. The Plone based website
        at CUBIC contains the main HTML webpage, and some of these pages are
        autogenerated from CVS sources.
