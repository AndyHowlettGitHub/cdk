      <para>
        Currently only tar.gz packages are available. The packages
        can be found in CVS /cdk/packages/tar. These packages can be
        installed on UNIX type operating systems in a few steps
        (replace the 20020206 with the latest release date):
      <programlisting>
$ gunzip cdk-libs-20020206.tar.gz
$ tar xvf cdk-libs-20020206.tar
$ cd cdk-libs-20020206
$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; install
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        Remember the correct order of installation is:
        cdk-libs, cdk-bin, cdk-test.

        At this moment Linux users should use and install the
        above tar.gz packages, unless they are Debian users.
        They can install a Debian package.

        <title>Debian packages</title>
        <para>
          Debian packages are available from the SourceForge website and
          can be build from CVS. To build Debian packages, first recompile
          CDK with "ant dist-all" to make fresh and up to data jar's.
          Then build the Debian packages in the directory packages/debian.
          First build libcdkextra which is the Debian package for CDK's
          cdk-libs tar package. It includes only those jars that are not
          packaged in other Debian packages. The next package to build
          is libcdk, which include the CDK jar files. It build-depends
          on libcdkextra, so you will need to install that one first.
          The last package to build is the package cdk. These latter two
          correspond to the CDK tar package cdk-bin.
          All debian packages are build by typing the following in the
          appropriate directory:
          <programlisting>
$ make deb
          </programlisting>
        </para>
