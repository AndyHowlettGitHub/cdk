      <title>JavaDoc</title>

      <para>
        Most of the documentation about the CDK classes is done in the
        java source files itself. The format used for this is the JavaDoc
        format. An overview/introduction can be found at <ulink
        url="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>
        JavaDoc documentation is now generated using Javadoc and
        Ant:
        <programlisting>
cdk/$ ant -buildfile javadoc.xml html
        </programlisting>
      </para>

      <section id="sect:javadoctags">
        <title>JavaDoc Tags</title>

        <para>
          The two sub sections contain suggested policy and is not yet as such
          approved.
        </para>

        <section>
          <title>Tagging classes</title>
          <para>
            Java classes should have the JavaDoc tags
            @copyright and @author. In addition, they may have
            @keyword tags.
          </para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Tagging procedures</title>
          <para>
            Procedures of classes should give information about what they do
            and information about parameters (@param) and things they
            return (@return).
          </para>
          <para>
            If the procedure performs a method found in literature, it should
            mention the reference. No format for the reference has been determined,
            but the BibTex format, or a link to
            http://cdk.sf.net/biblio.html#ARTID should do fine.
          </para>

      <section id="sect:docbookdoclet">
        <title>DocbookDoclet</title>

        <para>
          The JavaDoc documentation can be converted into DocBook code
          with the DocBookDoclet (<ulink
          url="http://freshmeat.net/projects/dbdoclet/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/dbdoclet/</ulink>).
          The DocBook output can in turn be generated into PDF files.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="sect:javadocstats">
        <title>JavaDoc Statistics</title>
        <para>
          Statistics can be generated on the use of JavaDoc in the
          CDK library. It can be generated with:
        <programlisting>
$ cd cdk/reports/javadoc
$ ant -Dpathtojava3d=/some/path overview
        </programlisting>
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="sect:keywordindex">
        <title>Keyword Index</title>
        <para>
          A keyword index is used for the website and is generated
          with the MakeKeywordIndexDoclet doclet. The file
          keyword.index.xml can be generated with:
        <programlisting>
$ cd cdk/reports/javadoc
$ ant -Dpathtojava3d=/some/path keyword.index
        </programlisting>
        </para>
      </section>

    <chapter id="sect:UML-diagrams">
      <title>UML Diagrams</title>

      <para>
        The CDK projects uses UML diagrams to visualize relations between
        classes and libraries. Diagrams are drawn in
        <ulink url="http://www.argouml.org/">ArgoUML</ulink> and
        <ulink url="http://www.gentleware.com/download/download2.php3?target=poseidonCEzip">Poseidon 
        for UML (Community Edition 1.2)</ulink>.
        The latter is a commercialized version of the former and does quite an
        excellent job in converting java source to UML diagrams, almost
        automatically.

    <chapter id="sect:cdk-tutorial">
      <title>CDK Programming Tutorial</title>

      <para>There is a sort of CDK Programming Tutorial online. It is
        written in DocBook XML 4.1.2 (like most of our documentation).</para>
