    <title>The Development of CDK</title>
    <para>The CDK project was started in September 2000 in South Bend, IN, USA at the
	  Notre Dame University. Dan Gzelter, Christoph Steinbeck and Egon Willighagen
	  agreed on merging the underlying core classes of JChemPaint and Jmol.</para>

      The development of all of our project will be organized via Sourceforge.
      Unfortunately, this system, as good as it is, turns out to be buggy and
      overloaded, but we'll stay with it, because this will not be so much of
      a problem as soon as the projects are established, we have the CVS
      access via SSH up'n running and can actually do some programming.
