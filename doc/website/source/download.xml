      <para>
        The best way to keep your CDK libraries up to date is to use
        Concurrent Version System. Linux/Unix distributions include this
        software. Other users may have to find a client for their platform
        on the internet (or download one of the packages below).

        <para>
          CDK is distributed as a tar.gz source package from which it can be compiled.
          On Linux/Solaris/BSD systems, it can be installed with the normal
          <command>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</command>.
        </para>
        <para>
          On Windows systems
          CDK cannot be installed automatically, but it can be compiled with
          Ant: <command>ant dist-all</command>.
        </para>
        <para>
        The package can be downloaded
        <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=20024">here</ulink>.

      <title>Binary Linux Package</title>
        <para>
          In addition to the source package, Debian user's can also download a Debian
          package. Keep in mind that the Debian package is uploaded to SF a few days
          later than the source package.
