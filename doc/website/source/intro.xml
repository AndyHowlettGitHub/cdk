			The CDK project was started in September 2000 to replace the CompChem libraries used by
			JChemPaint, Jmol and SENECA. It no longer is in its initial stage, but is slowly getting a solid
			state. The people involved are those in the
			<ulink url="http://www.ice.mpg.de/departments/cheminf">Chemoinformatics Group</ulink> at the
			<ulink url="http://www.ice.mpg.de">Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena</ulink>,
			as well as <ulink url="mailto:egonw@sci.kun.nl">Egon Willighagen</ulink> from the University of Nijmegen,
			who is also involved with JChemPaint and many other Java Chemoinformatics programs, and
			<ulink url="mailto:gezelter@maul.chem.nd.edu">Dan Gezelter</ulink>, the initiator of JMol, a 3D viewer and analyzer for molecules .
		</para>

			Now, the rewrite of these CompChem/CDK library classes do somehow effect
			all of our projects.
			All of our code relies to some extend on the so-called CompChem classes
			for computational chemistry. I started this chemistry library when I
			started programming SENECA, my system for Computer Assisted Structure Elucidation.
			It turned out that some of
			the code had design flaws that prevented others, like the authors of
			(<ulink url="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">JMol</ulink>) to use it.
			Egon, Dan and I now met in September 2000 at the University of Notre Dame,
			South Bend, Chicago, and redesigned the CompChem classes, calling the
			new project the "Chemistry Development Kit, CDK".

			Of course, at Notre Dame we were not able to do all the implementations.
			We decided to take some more care this time and start with UML. There
			are some UML diagrams on the CVS at
			http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cdk which can be views with the
			program Linux program dia. Egon has moved them to ArgoUML,
			which is Java and can also be used under Windows.
		</para>
		<para>
			The first step to do now is to create java classes for of all the
			existing UML diagrams. The second step is to fill them with life as it become clear what is
			needed while porting JChemPaint to them
