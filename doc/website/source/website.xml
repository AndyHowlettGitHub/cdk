    <para>The CDK classes are Java utitility classes for ChemoInformatics and
      Computational chemistry, written in Java. They are developed constantly
      developed parallel to other projects that make use of them. They are a
      complete re-write of the CompChem classes that were the basis of JChemPaint,
      a Java Editor for 2D chemical structures, and of JMDraw, a Java package
      for the graphical layout of 2D chemical structures.
