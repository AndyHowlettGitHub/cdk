                 <title>What is the CDK?</title>
                 <para>
        The CDK classes are Java utitility classes for ChemoInformatics and Computational chemistry, written in Java. They are developed constantly developed parallel
        to other projects that make use of them.
        They are a complete re-write of the CompChem classes that were the basis of <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/JChemPaint">JChemPaint</ulink>, a Java Editor
        for 2D chemical structures, and of <ulink url="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jmdraw">JMDraw</ulink>, a Java package for the graphical layout of 2D chemical structures
                </para>

                <para>
        A re-write was needed to in order to assure the widest possible usability. It is also intended to port
        <ulink url="http://www.openscience.org/jmol">JMol</ulink>, a 3D molecular visualization tool, to the CDK.
                </para>
                <para>
                        The CDK classes support (or will support, as soon as ported from the old CompChem library):

                                                A class that parses a molecular formula (a String of characters) and returns an array of Nodes.

                                                An isomorphisms tester that compares to structures and returns if they are isomorph. I'm almost sure, that the implementation is not strictly valid, but it
                                                seems to work
