      Build dependencies denote jars that are required to get the CDK
      classes compiled. But, classes can be loaded using a ClassLoader too,
      and then the library is not required to be present while compiling
      the CDK class; ofcourse, the class is required to be present when
      the CDK class is used. Such dependencies are called run-time
      dependencies.
