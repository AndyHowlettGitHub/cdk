    <title>Proposal</title>
    <para>
    I propose that aromaticity is generally coded by setting a
 CDKConstants.ISAROMATIC flag both in the aromatic ring atoms as well as 
 in the aromatic ring bonds.
 	</para>
	<para>
 Aromatic ring systems are not only detected by classes like
 org.openscience.cdk.aromaticity.HueckelAromaticityDetector, but they may 
 also be created by parsing SMILES strings. In the latter case, no 
 alternating single/double bond pattern is given, but the ring atom 
 symbols are either written in lower case letters or the bond symbols 
 indicate an "aromatic" bond.
 	</para>
	<para>
 HueckelAromaticityDetector sets these flags when it finds an aromatic 
 ring and it also obeys these flags when searching a given structure for 
 aromaticity.
 	</para>
	<para>
 SMILESParser will establish a bond order of 1.5 between the aromatic 
 bonds (in order to keep the bond sum correct) and but will also set the 
 above flag. Afterward there is the option of having another (yet to 
 create) class establish an alternating single/double bond pattern.
 	</para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Reason</title>
    <para>
    
    1. A chemical drawing and rendering program needs a flag like this in 
 order to know when to draw a circle inside a ring instead of the 
 alternating double/single bond pattern.
 	</para>
	<para>
    2. SMILESParser should have a simple method of setting aromaticity. 
 Having it find a valid alternating double/single bond pattern would 
 overload its functionality.
    
    </para>
