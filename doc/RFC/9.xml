  <refsect1>
    <title>Proposal</title>
    <para>The .toString() methods of the core classes give information about the content 
of the class. My proposal is that the resulting String of these methods is a 
String without \n and \r chars (thus a one-liner) that gives an overview of 
the class. Being a one-liner, the output can be used in Log4J debugging 
output, without having the problem that lines in the output become 
multilined.
</para>
    <para>Note that I assume that the toString() method is not to be used for formating 
the atom's properties, but just for quick developers access to its contents.</para>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Reason</title>
    <para>At this moment the Log4J output is complicated by multilined debug lines like:
<programlisting>
2002-11-26 15:11:58,883 [main] DEBUG org.openscience.cdk.applications.Viewer - 
0. Atom Hg
Hydrogen count: 0
Stereo Parity: 0
2D coordinates: (0.0021, -0.0041)
3D coordinates: (0.0021, -0.0041, 0.0020)
Partial charge: 0.0
Formal charge: 0
</programlisting>
    A simple "grep -v applications.Viewer" now no longer removes all output from 
the applications.Viewer class. If the atom.toString() output would be 
one-lined, filtering could be done much easier.
</para>
