    <refname>RFC CDK #20: Removal of get/setRemark and get/setPhysicalProperty from ChemObject</refname>
  </refnamediv>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Proposal</title>
    <para>
      To remove the get/setRemark() and get/setPhysicalProperty() methods from
      the ChemObject class.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Reason</title>
    <para>
      First, they are not used in the CDK library itself, and only make the ChemObject
      larger. Secondly, their use is easily replace by the more general
      get/setProperty(), as remarks and physical properties are instances of the
      general idea property.
    </para>
    <para>
      Optionally, one can circumvent collisions with others in two ways:
      If you use a String as a property identifier, as is done often in the CDK
      library, you could use a namespace to prefix the property identifier. This
      approach is followed by the current cdk.dict package. Secondly, one could
      use a subclass of String, or any class, and use that class as a property
      identifier; this is possible, because the ChemObject.setProperty() method
      takes an Object as identifier, and not just String objects.
