INSTALL GUIDE

  This is a quickly made installation manual...
  There are a couple of things you must do before you
  can use this software.

1. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES

  1.1 COMPILING CDK

  First thing it do, is to check wether you have all the required 
  software to compile CDK. You need: 

    - Java 1.3 or better
    - Ant (see http://www.apache.org/)
    
  The generation of the man pages need the xsltproc tool.

  Optionally, you it can use:

    - JOELib (http://joelib.sf.net/)
    - Jmol   (http://jmol.sf.net/)
    - Java3D

  1.2 RUNNING CDK

  Running CDK in principle requires only:

    - Java 1.3 or better

  But some applications of CDK need additional tools. The shell scripts
  cdk-* for Unix systems need Perl installed. The CDK can store structures
  in a database but this requires MySQL or PostgreSQL.

2. INSTALLATION

  2.1 AUTOMATIC COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION

  Do:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

  By default the software is installed in /usr/local. You can configure the location
  by doing:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

  or

  ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/cdk-bin


  2.2 MANUAL COMPILATION

  There is no installation system for systems without Autotools, but you can still
  compile and run CDK. Compiling is done with Ant:

  ant dist-all

  Running CDK is done with:

  java -cp $CLASSPATH cdk-apps.jar org.openscience.cdk.applications.Viewer
  
  2.3 CHANGING SOURCE CODE
  
  People are encouraged to change the source code, or add new classes with new
  functionality. The make system does not automatically recognize new source code,
  but you can recompile CDK with your local changes by doing:
  
  make clean
  make
  make install
  
  The first command should force a recompile of the source code with the second
  command.
