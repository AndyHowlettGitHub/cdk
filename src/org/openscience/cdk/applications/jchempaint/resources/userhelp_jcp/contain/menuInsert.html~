<h2>The Insert Menu</h2>

<h3>From Internet</h3>
 <p>If a connection to the internet is active, you can download 2D structures 
 from the Internet into a new frame. The DADML setting (see ???) defines a 
 super database which in its place defines databases from which structures can 
 be downloaded automatically.</p>
 <p>Indices are also determined dynamically, by querying the superdatabase. 
 Normally, CAS and NSC indices are expected.</p>
 <p>An example is downloading formaldehyde which has the CAS number 50-00-0. 
 In most cases the structures downloaded by its NSC number result in a 2D 
 projection of 3D structures. These structures can be &ldquo cleaned up &rdquo 
 (see the section called &ldquoThe Cleanup Button &rdquo) . </p>

 <h3>Insert SMILES</h3>
 <p>Can be used in to type a SMILES structure of which the structure is to be drawn.</p>
 <p>The SMILES is parsed by CDK's smiles.SmilesParser class and layout into a 2D
    structure using the layout.StructureDiagramGenerator.</p>
