<h2>The Button Panel</h2>
<p>
Below is an explanantion of the function of the buttons in the button panel. 
But before starting that, let's note the source code which offers this functionality.<br>
JChemPaint's source code provides only the GUI part, but all the 
chemoinformational algorithms which make JChemPaint an editor, are provided by 
CDK. The two main classes of interest are:
<ul type="circle">
  <li>the renderer.Renderer2D </li>
  <li>controller.Controller2D </li>
</ul>
The first deals with graphical rendering of 
the chemical information and the second deals with user input using mouse and 
button events, and does extend the renderer with editing features.
But the Controller2D does not all editing; it only does the editing 
functionality in some editing mode, like the drawing and bond mode. A few 
other buttons, and most menu items do not use the functionality in this class, 
but provide algorithms from other CDK classes. Where possible, the information 
about the buttons will also link to the CDK classes that provide the algorithms used.
<p>
<h3>The Drawing Buttons</h3><br>
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The drawing button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>Puts JChemapint in the draw mode, which is the standard mode in which 
     build up chemical structures. If selected you can click on a point on 
     the document and you'll create a single atom at this point. If you click, 
     hold and drag the mouse, a bond is created. Multiple clicking on an 
     existing bond will cycle its bond order between the values 1, 2 and 3.</p>
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
   
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The up-bond button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>This mode enables you to change an existing bond into a filled
     wedge - the standard stereo bond desribing that the atom at the thick 
     end is above the 2D plane in which your are supposed to imagine the atom 
     at the thin end. Further, if selected, multiple clicking on an existing 
     bond will change it to a filled wedge and if it already has this shape 
     it will toggle between the two possible orientations</p>.
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The down-bond button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>This mode enables you to change an existing bond into a dashed 
     wedge - the standard stereo bond describing that the atom at the thin end
     is below the 2D plane in which your are supposed to imagine the atom at 
     the thick end. Further, if selected, multiple clicking on an existing 
     bond will change it to a dashed wedge and if it already has this shape it 
     will toggle between the two possible orientations.</p>
     </p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The down-bond button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>The ring templates, like,    ,    ,    , allow you to draw single 
     rings and complex ringsystems from a few predefined templates.</p>
     <p>A click on an atom places the preselected ring such that the atoms 
     on which you clicked is one of the ring atoms. Click on a bond and it 
     will be part of the newly created ring. A new ring is always placed 
     on the least hindered side of the system. If you don't like the result, 
     you can click on a bond, hold the mouse button and use the appearing 
     gray line to indicate side of the bond on which you want to have the 
     ring placed. Atoms of the newly place ring that are within the snap 
     radius of existing atoms will be fused with these.</p>
     </p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li> Buttons for Moving</li>
   </ul>
     <p>These buttons operate on selected items. This can either be done by 
     choosing the mode in question and manipulating single atoms, or by 
     selecting multiple items with the lasso and switching into the desired 
     mode for performing the operation.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li> The Translate Button </li>
   </ul>
     <p>This buttone lets you move selected objects in the xy plane.</p>
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by 
     the controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li> The Translate Button </li>
   </ul>
     <p>This buttone lets you move selected objects in the xy plane.</p>
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by 
     the controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
<h3>Buttons for other operations</h3><br>
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>  The Toggle Symbol Button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>This drawing mode allows toggling of the atom's element by clicking 
     one or more time on an atom. It toggles between a few common elements.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The Element Symbol Button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>This button allows selecting a new drawing element from a list a 
     periodic table.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li> The Eraser Button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>This mode makes it possible to deletin selected objects, no matter 
     if preselected with the lasso or selected on the fly by clicking on an 
     object when in eraser mode.</p>
     </p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The Select (Lasso) Button </li>
   </ul>
     <p>In this mode one can select objects with a lasso.</p>
     <p>The algorithms behind this button are provided by the 
     controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
     
   <ul type="circle">
     <li>The Cleanup Button</li>
   </ul>
     <p>Clicking this button cleans up the structure on the screen, using 
     the MDraw algorithm [ BLE91 ]. </p>
     <p>JChemPaint 2.x uses the CDK implementation 
     of this algorithm in the controller.Controller2D class.</p><br>
