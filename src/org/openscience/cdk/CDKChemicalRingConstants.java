 * An interface providing predefined values for a number of

 * atom typing process (Zero is set to undefined). Classes using these constants should
 * <b>not</b> implement this interface, but use it like:
 * <pre>
 *   int IS_IN_HETRING = CDKRingConstants.IS_IN_HETRING;
 *   or as Flag:
 *   atom.setFlag(CDKConstants.IS_IN_HETRING, true);

 *
 * <p>The lazyCreation patch has been applied to this class.
 *
 *	Hetero ring systems must get an even number, carbon ring systems
