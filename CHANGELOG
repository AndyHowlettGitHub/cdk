CHANGELOG
------------------------------------

Changes in CVS
------------------------------------
New:
* Added a class for representing crystals
* Added a class for reading PolyMorph Predictor (r)
  *.pmp files
* Added a class for reading ShelX files
* The SMILES generator now also supports chirality
* cdk-fileconvert supports one-to-many conversion
  (e.g. PMP contains many crystals, while ShelX 
   can contain only one crystal. Thus, when converting
   PMP to ShelX more than one file is created.)
* Added a method MFAnalyser.getElement() which returns
  a Vector with asorted element names
* Added a Comparator that can sort element names
  according to: C,H, then others (alphabetically)

Fixes:
* Added initialization of atoms Array in Bond.java
  constructor
* Fixed parsing of ChemDraw created SMILES (#593648)

API changes:
* cdk.libio.jmol.Convertor now converts 
  AtomContainer <-> ChemFrame, instead of
  Molecule <-> ChemFrame
* FortranFormat moved to org.openscience.cdk.math
* GeomertryTools.hasXDCoordinates() now accepts
  AtomContainer instead of Molecule
* ChemObjectWriters must now also implement the 
  method highestSupportedChemObject()

  (lists OS version/arch and Java version/vendor)
* adding Rendered3D which does not use Java3D (not yet operational)
